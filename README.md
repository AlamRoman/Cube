# Cube
This Java project illustrates the projection of a 3D cube onto a 2D plane, using projection matrix for the transformation onto the screen coordinates and rotation matrices for orientation. This simulates how a 3D object would appear when viewed from a specific perspective.  
Rotation Matrices: Separate rotation matrices are used for rotations around the X, Y, and Z axes to control the orientation of the cube in 3D space.  
Projection Matrix: A simple 2D projection matrix is employed to project the rotated 3D coordinates onto the 2D screen.
